          Congratulations on the purchase of your new expeditionary vessel. To ensure proper operation and avoid damages, injuries or a loss of productivity please take the time to go through the startup procedure for this vessel. As a ship that is primarily a lightly crewed planetary gas miner, there will be some extra steps required to render your vessel fully operational.

        [head=2] Operational Hazards [/head]

          [head=3]Gas Extraction Chamber[/head] - The Gas Extractor will contain volatile gasses over the course of operation. Do not under any circumstances mix your air with the extract mix.

        [head=3]Pre-Flight Checklist:[/head]
          ◗ Ensure the generator is running, and filled with AME Fuel. If needed, there are HV ports at the Fore and Starboard sides of the ship for a solars expansion.
          ◗ Configure the air alarms from within the atmos observation area. The starboard chamber leads to breathable air tanks, the port side chamber is to be used for volatile gases.
          ◗ The atmosphere in the living quarters may require manual refilling after several hours of continuous use. This can be done using the filled cans on the exterior platform.
